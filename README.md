# Hey there 👋 I'm [Your Name]

I'm a B.Tech CSE student, caffeine-fueled front-end enthusiast, and aspiring developer who occasionally wins the battle against bugs (and sometimes doesn't).  

I build with:
- 🖌️ **HTML** – Because everything starts with a skeleton  
- 🎨 **CSS** – Making divs look slightly less ugly since [your year]  
- ⚙️ **JavaScript** – Turning clicks into chaos  
- 💻 **C/C++** – For when I want to remember pain and pointers

## 🚧 Currently Working On
- Making responsive layouts without breaking everything  
- Writing cleaner JavaScript that doesn't scare future-me  
- Understanding how `position: absolute;` betrayed me again  
- Saying no to inline CSS (and meaning it)

---

## 📚 Currently Learning
- Real projects that don’t live only in `index.html`  
- Git (the push-and-pray method is under review)  
- Debugging with less crying  
- Building a proper portfolio (someday, I swear)

---

## 🐸 Fun Facts
- My favorite color is `#ff5733`  
- I treat `console.log()` like a therapist  
- I name my projects things like `final_final_v2_reallyFinalThisTime`
