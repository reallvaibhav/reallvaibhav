# "Experience"

Former Executive of Unclear Objectives at the Global Institute of Vaguely Technical Things™.  
Led multiple circular projects to completion, often redefining what "completion" means.  
Oversaw end-to-end delivery of conceptual synergies, including a 4-hour team call that resulted in one emoji.  

Once helped migrate a monolith into an even bigger monolith, now with 40% more microservices and emotional damage.  
Proud inventor of the “push directly to main and hope” deployment strategy.
